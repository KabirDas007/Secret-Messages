The ps4a file contains the code to return all permutations of a string supplied as argument.   
In random substitution cypher, I am only substituting vowels for other vowels,and during decryiption every permutation of the vowels is checked to see if its a good fit.<br>
Substituting every alphabet in random cypher will take the total number of permutation the computer will need to check- in order to decrypt the message- to 26!.<br> A very large number.<br>
This problem does not exist for the ceaser cypher where the number of different substitutions are always 26 only. <br>
The substitution that gives maximum number of valid words is choosen in both the cypher methods. (Valid words are the words that are written in the 'word.txt file')<br>
