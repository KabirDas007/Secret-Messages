The ps4a file contains the code to return all permutations of a string supplied as argument.   
In random substitution cypher, I am only substituting vowels for other vowels, as substituting every alphabet
will lead the total number of permutation the computer will need to check in order to decrypt the message will be 26!. a very large number.
This problem does not exist for the ceaser cypher where the number of different substitutions are always 26 only. 
The substitution that gives maximum number of valid words is choosen in both the cypher methods. (Valid words are the words that are written in the 'word.txt file')
