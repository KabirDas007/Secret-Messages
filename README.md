The ps4a file contains the code to return all permutations of a string supplied as argument.   
In random substitution cypher, I am only substituting vowels for other vowels,and during decryiption every permutation of the vowels is checked to see if its a good fit.
Substituting every alphabet in random cypher will take the total number of permutation the computer will need to check- in order to decrypt the message- to 26!. A very large number.
This problem does not exist for the ceaser cypher where the number of different substitutions are always 26 only. 
The substitution that gives maximum number of valid words is choosen in both the cypher methods. (Valid words are the words that are written in the 'word.txt file')
